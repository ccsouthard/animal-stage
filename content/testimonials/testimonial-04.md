C. Southard tackled what was, for me, an overwhelming project by juggling immediate Web creation needs with his strong desire and ability to organize, design, and update my site. Another key success measure the ability to communicate well -- our email and phone conversations were thoughtful and thorough. I always felt -- and continue to feel -- that Chaz's enthusiasm for me and my work shines through.
