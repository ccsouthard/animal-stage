    The Country Carpenter came to us again to redesign their website to showcase some of their exceptional custom kitchens and internal additions.

    The Country Carpenter Remodeling Company is a full-service build/design  company.  The Country Carpenter specializes in custom kitchens, baths and additions. They wanted to create a corporate identity that brings a country feel together with a sleek logo that promotes friendliness, attention to detail and quality workmanship.

    The logo and identity design have been used in business cards, signs, pamphlets and other promotional items.

    We are able to merge a clean user interface, while integrating textures and components from everyday working materials. The homepage boasts of a cement background, a quote that is framed in architectural patterns and integrates grayscale to color animations.
